# spongecalendarbot
a twitter bot (@spongecalendar) to tweet the date, everyday

initially conceived to use a frame from The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie (HIllenburg, 2004), to be automatically edited and uploaded with the correct date every morning.
unfortunately i did not know how to do any of this before, and now that i know what an API is elmo has ruined twitter's

for now, it should tweet de date and some cool ascii art i found online (if you made it lmk and i'll buy you two beers). also some emojis to evoke the correct feeling

i only learned how to do all this yesterday, so it doesn't even tweet on its own yet. i'm researching that right now

thanks and if you find this and can help me hit me up at twitter @2budin2furious or telegram @budindepunk
